# acs
Automotive control systems. Development and demonstration board. Generic usage. Focused on designing and developing a CAN bus network for intrusion detection system studies.

# What does this repository contain?
This repo contains a custom board design to simulate automotive ECUs like VCU, BMS, Inverter etc. Moreover, this repo also include a CAN bus database structure to create a real world simulation on a custom test bench. This test bench is designed with 4 main ECU. It can be extended or collapsed based on the research study.
